            <p style="text-align: justify;">Matthew Healy, the son of actors Denise Welch and Tim Healy, grew up in Newcastle and Cheshire. He met Ross MacDonald, Adam Hann
            and George Daniel at Wilmslow High School in 2002; as teenagers, they played together. The band formed when a local council worker
            organized numerous gigs for teens. Healy found Hann who "came up to [him] and said he wanted to play one of these shows." The band
            began playing covers until they "eventually wrote a song," according to Healy. "We started from then and we've been making music
            together since we were about 15." After Hann invited the members to form a band, they passed their early days covering punk songs in a
            local club. Healy was originally the drummer but took over for vocals after the previous singer left to start another band. George Daniel was
            recruited as the new drummer to complete the final line up. The band formerly performed under Me and You Versus Them, Forever Drawing
            Six, Talkhouse, The Slowdown, Bigsleep, and Drive Like I Do, before settling on The 1975. Healy recounts that the name was inspired by
            scribblings found on the backpage of a poetry book by Jack Kerouac that stated "1 June, The 1975."</p>

            radio attention in late 2012, with BBC Radio 1 DJ Zane Lowe championing their single "Sex" from the from the EP of the same name, which
